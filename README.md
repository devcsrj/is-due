Your one-stop app for managing Philippine service provider invoices.

Although service providers in the Philippines have a web portal for accessing invoices, they're either slow, dated, unreliable - usually all of the above. The frustrations in navigating these crappy web portals led me to write this tool to aggregate all of my invoices in one place.

Interestingly enough, this project also made me realize how unsecure and horribly written the said web portals are.
